[Post] I feel violated by intern season: There's this bar that I frequent a few blocks away from my house. Technically different neighborhood, but generally has a mature vibe with people who like music and to dance. Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.
 I was at the wrong party. 

As I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.
 Naturally I felt violated

But then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. 
New York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.

[Post] What needs to happen for the league to review the inconsistencies of the refs?: [removed]
[Post] Are you guys for/against banning Tiktok in the US?: [removed]
[Post] What’s a movie that best represents your childhood?: There's so many coming of age movies for boomers and millennials, what about for gen-Z?
[Post] Spacial tours with 3D map and 360˚ video: 
[Post] Best blogs, tutorial channels to learn: Hey I’m an iOS developer building in visionOS. Do people have recommendations on resources to catch up on new featuresets for spacial computing?
[Post] Can't wait for Vision Air 5 launching in 2034 with these transparent displays!: 
[Post] Watching Edgerunners on the moon feels: Thank you u/overpaidengineer for the inspo
[Comment] Sorry to hear that man, in the future you may want to have multiple granaries, one close to your berries/deer/fish and one for your veggies/apples/honey.
Also I just store ale at the tavern or keep it in the brewery for this reason
[Comment] Yeah but it doesn’t seem to affect much though
[Comment] Incredible stuff! How did you maintain character consistency? Did you generate a consistent character image and then use the image-to-video feature?
[Comment] I do too but I rarely finish a game haha. Too little late game content

[Comment] You have to kill the bandit units, or donate crop yields though the manor (tithing, different from taxation).
[Comment] That proximity is ridiculous, deep mining, two fishing huts, vegetable, orchards, and trade iron for malt.
imo trading raw materials is easier than trading crafted goods in the current build. High quantity stuff is easy to stock, and you could have multiple trading posts up without any major issues.
The exact opposite of this is plate armor. It takes forever to build, requires three points, and needs eight iron slabs to make it. It’s cheaper to just export the ore, and since it’s a low quantity trade, it’s hard to stick multiple trade posts with it
[Comment] Yeah I was doing alright and then as soon as I upgraded to tier 3 my town was in shambles. I didn’t notice how demanding it was going to be
[Comment] So in general each family will eat each type of food equally. Which means those with low supply are more likely to be consumed first.

Eggs I believe each plot only produces one per month, so it's helpful, but won't be sufficient to maintain food diversity
[Comment] I build my cities close to the borders of others, that way I'm not managing multiple cities at once. The best is building it at the three-way border. That way you're basically managing three cities at once.

User Persona:
Comment] The best way to keep your character consistent is to make sure your images are identical to each other.
[Post] Is there a rule for how much or how little you have to pay for a meal? How does the cost of a meal work?
[Comment] I think it's in the price of the food, but I don’t think it's in the price of the drink.
[Post] I would like to start a restaurant/restaurant that uses a traditional style of food.
[Comment] I just don’t think that there are many options for different types of food.
[Post] I really don’t think that people like the traditional style of eating. I am not a doctor or a dietitian, but I think that the traditional style of eating is less effective, at least for me. It's a different style, and I think it is more palatable.
[Comment] I don’t think that I am able to eat a lot of vegetables, and I don’t think that I should eat more of my food than other people.
[Comment] I am a foodie and I think that's a good thing in general for me, but
